ðŸ“˜ README: Errors and Exception Handling in Python
ðŸ§  What This Page Is About
This page is your beginner-friendly guide to understanding errors in Python and how to deal with them so your programs donâ€™t crash unexpectedly. It teaches you how to spot mistakes, fix them, and even prepare your code to handle problems gracefully when they happen.

ðŸ§© Topics Covered
What are Python Errors?

Syntax Errors: Mistakes in how your code is written (like missing punctuation or wrong indentation).

Exceptions: Problems that happen while your code is running (like dividing by zero or using a variable that doesnâ€™t exist).

How to Handle Exceptions

Learn how to use special tools in Python like try, except, else, and finally to catch and respond to errors.

Example: If someone tries to divide by zero, your program can catch that and show a friendly message instead of crashing.

Raising Your Own Errors

You can create your own rules and raise errors when something goes wrong using the raise keyword.

Creating Custom Exceptions

Make your own error types for specific situations in your app.

Example: If a product is out of stock, you can raise a custom error called OutOfStockError to let the user know.

ðŸŽ¯ What Youâ€™ll Learn
The difference between syntax errors and runtime exceptions.

Common Python errors like ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, and NameError.

How to write code that handles errors smoothly.

How to create your own custom error messages for better clarity.

ðŸ›  Practice Exercises
Divide Two Numbers

Try dividing two numbers and handle the case where the second number is zero.

Read a File

Try opening a file and show a message if the file doesnâ€™t exist.

Custom Error

Create a new error called ValueTooHighError that shows up if someone enters a number bigger than 100.

ðŸ“š Why This Matters
Errors are part of programming. Learning how to handle them makes your code stronger, safer, and easier to use. This page helps you build that skill step by step.
