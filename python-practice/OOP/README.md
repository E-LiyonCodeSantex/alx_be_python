📘 README: Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
🧠 What This Page Is About
This page is a gentle introduction to a way of writing computer programs called Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It’s written for people learning how to code using Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

🧩 What Is OOP?
Imagine you're organizing your life into neat boxes. One box is for your car, another for your dog, another for your phone. Each box contains details (like color, size, brand) and actions (like drive, bark, call). OOP helps programmers organize their code in a similar way—by grouping related things together.

🧱 Key Ideas Explained Simply
Objects: Think of these as real-life things like a car or a dog. Each object has details (like color or age) and actions it can do (like drive or bark).

Classes: These are like blueprints. If you want to build many cars, you start with a car blueprint. A class defines what an object should look like and what it can do.

Encapsulation: This means keeping all the related stuff (details and actions) inside one box so it’s tidy and protected.

Inheritance: Like passing traits from parents to children. If you have a general “Vehicle” class, a “Car” class can inherit its features.

Polymorphism: A fancy word meaning “many forms.” It lets objects behave differently depending on the situation.

🚗 Example: The Car Blueprint
Here’s a simple example from the page:

You create a car with details like make, model, and year.

You can check how many miles it has driven.

You can update or increase the mileage.

This helps you understand how to build your own “objects” in code that behave like real-world things.

📝 Practice Exercises
To help you learn, the page includes:

Creating a “Student” with name and age.

Building a “Product” with price and quantity, and calculating its total value.

📚 Why This Matters
OOP makes your code easier to understand, reuse, and maintain—especially when building big projects. It’s like organizing your thoughts clearly so others (and future you) can follow along.
